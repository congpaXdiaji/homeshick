Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications Second Edition is a comprehensive and modern textbook that covers the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and their applications to various physical systems. The book is written by Nouredine Zettili, an Algerian physics educator who holds a Bachelor of Science from University of Algiers, Algeria, and a Master of Science and a Doctor of Philosophy from Massachusetts Institute of Technology[^3^]. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students who want to learn quantum mechanics in a clear and rigorous way.

The book is divided into 14 chapters, each covering a major topic in quantum mechanics. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts and postulates of quantum mechanics, such as the wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, and the Dirac notation. The second chapter deals with the mathematical tools and techniques that are essential for solving quantum problems, such as linear algebra, complex numbers, operators, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and Hilbert spaces. The third chapter discusses the one-dimensional problems in quantum mechanics, such as the free particle, the potential step, the potential barrier, the square well, and the harmonic oscillator.
 
The fourth chapter extends the discussion to three-dimensional problems in quantum mechanics, such as the angular momentum operators, the spherical harmonics, the hydrogen atom, and the spin. The fifth chapter introduces the formalism of quantum mechanics, such as the state vector, the observables, the measurement postulate, the probability interpretation, and the uncertainty relations. The sixth chapter explores the time evolution of quantum systems, such as the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation, the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation, the stationary states, and the time evolution operator. The seventh chapter covers the approximation methods in quantum mechanics, such as the perturbation theory, the variational method, and the WKB approximation.

The eighth chapter discusses the identical particles and the many-body systems in quantum mechanics, such as the bosons, the fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle, the symmetrization postulate, and the Hartree-Fock method. The ninth chapter introduces the scattering theory in quantum mechanics, such as the scattering cross section, the partial wave analysis, the Born approximation, and the phase shifts. The tenth chapter covers the relativistic quantum mechanics, such as the Klein-Gordon equation, the Dirac equation, the negative energy states, and the hole theory.
